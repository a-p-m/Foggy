FOGGY is an interactive productivity tool designed to assist in the 
composition of monthly reports, project plans, memos to management 
and so forth.  If entered without parameters, FOGGY generates as 
output a high-fog-index sentence suitable for befuddling even the 
most determined seeker-after-content.  If you need vast amounts of 
FOGGY for really serious tush-covering, enter the number of sentences 
needed as a parameter.  For example, entering 'FOGGY -s5' outputs 
half a screen of heat-treated, battle- hard, industrial-strength 
slop, well suited to choking hogs and assurance planners.

REMEMBER:
FOGGY can be a terrible weapon -- never abuse it.

This implementation of Foggy was based on a REXX version of FOGGY 
published on the Simple Talk forums, and reputed to have been based 
on code written for an OS/360 system in the seventies.
